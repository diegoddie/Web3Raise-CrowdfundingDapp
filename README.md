## Technologies Used
- ThirdWeb: A development framework for building decentralized applications on Ethereum.
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Vite: A fast build tool for modern web applications.
- Hardhat: A development environment for Ethereum smart contracts.
- SOlidity: The most important web3 language for writing smart contracts.

## Future Enhancements
- Toggle Dark/Light Theme: I am working on adding the ability for users to switch between a dark and light theme. This will provide a personalized visual experience and enhance usability based on individual preferences.

- Search Bar and Campaign Categories: I am actively developing a search functionality that will allow users to easily find specific campaigns based on keywords or categories. Additionally, I will introduce a categorization system for campaigns, enabling users to browse campaigns based on their interests or preferred causes.

I am committed to continuously improving Web3Raise and providing a seamless crowdfunding experience. Stay tuned for these exciting updates!

## Getting Started

Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template vite-javascript-starter
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/main.jsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

On `src/index.jsx`, you'll find our `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping your app,
this is necessary for our [hooks](https://portal.thirdweb.com/react) and
[UI Components](https://portal.thirdweb.com/ui-components) to work.

### Deploy to IPFS

Deploy a copy of your application to IPFS using the following command:

```bash
yarn deploy
```
